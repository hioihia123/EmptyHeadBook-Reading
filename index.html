      Before my great grandmother passed away, she always sat next to me and told me all kind of fairy tale stories every night. 
      Among her stories, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland really sparkled and printed its plot profoundly in my head. As Alice falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures, 
      I was so nervous and frightened for her. Of course, the ten years old version of me took these "unreal" stories pretty serious.
      I was sacred that someday I may experience something like Alice. Since the first time I heard Alice story, the fear of leaving my comfortable world  had haunted me for a whole month. <br>

In the blink of an eye, I officially got into the best middle school in my city. I was so proud of myself and became a little arrogrant. <i>"Who know the total area of this triangle?"</i>, my teacher loudly asked the class.
Nobody was able to solve this extremely difficult question, even the best kid in my classroom. <i>"Ms. Hoa, is it 432 metres-squared?" </i>, I confidently answered as I raised my hand up. Miss Hoa shockingly nodded her head. She told the class that the problem took her three days to figure it out and praised me as a genius. 
The moment the classmates cheered me up, the principal walked into my classroom and talked to me that my parents wanted to see me. I felt so strange about this visit. Why did they need to see me in the middle of the school day?. 
As my footsteps started approaching the principal's office, I heard my parents' voices. They were talking something about me. Something that seemed to be more important than my school hours. While my father was talking with the principal, my mother greeted me and told me that our family will move to the country called the United States of America ( USA ) to live and study.
 Although the two countries had been in war against each other, almost all of the Vietnamese families want to send their kids to the US to study. With the Vietnamese people, the education quality in the America has always been the best in the world.<br>
 I was shocked. The fear of leaving my beloved country from the childhood started getting back and haunting me again. Am I gonna be like Alice in her story or I will have my own story to tell ? Regardless , I didn't want to go to another country at all. 
Indeed, I tried to talk to my father many times about the fact that I wanted to stay here in Vietnam to study with my friends. BUT, he told me that let just experience to see which country is better. Experience ? What did he mean by experience in a completely unfamiliar country? <br>
On the depart date, I cried so much that both my eyes became bloodshot. As I waived the last goodbye to my grandparents, friends, and teachers, the tears from my eyes couldn't stop coming out. The memories just kept popping up in every steps to the plane. I won't be able to make new friends, learn new languages, and live in a foreign society. I just couldn't, couldn't, couldn't....
