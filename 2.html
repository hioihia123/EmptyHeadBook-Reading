    Living the American dream. I remembered this phrase when I was watching a cartoon on Disney channel. A dream in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, as well as an upward social mobility for the family and children, 
    achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. The term <i>"American Dream"</i>was coined by James Truslow 
    Adams in 1931, saying that <i>"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, 
    with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement"</i> regardless of social class or circumstances of birth. I never could have imagined that I'm about to live the American dream. It sounds so perfect, yet so hard to achieve.

The flight to the US took about 18 hours ( The longest flight in my entire life ). While I was sleeping, the captain's loudly announcement of arrival 
through the speaker suddenly woke me up. I was so excited and unhappy at the same time. Excited: I'am  about to meet new friends, teachers, persons and learn new things.
Unhappy: I won't be able to meet my old friends, teachers and my grandparents.<br>
On a freezing night in February 2017, the footsteps from a pair of boots that my grandparents gave me before departure were printed on the rough snowy road of the DFW Airport. I am in the United States of America- the greatest country in the world. From the third floor, I could see the night sky was aglow with Fort Worth city’s lights, and the pale crescent moon shone like a silvery claw in the deep dark sky.
Everything was still and silent, except the old engine of my uncle’s car. The moment we left the airport, my journey and 
dreams officially began. I did acknowledge that there will be numerous challenges, but the seemingly inexorable march of
 my unflinching determination will defeat every difficulty on my road to success.  My overwhelming excitement to learn new things
  and make new friends made it impossible for me to sleep that night. <br>
  While I was researching about how America middle school looks like, my father informed me that I would be exceptionally graduating from middle school if
       I attended for only four months in eighth grade. Shocked was my initial reaction. At that moment, 
       a thirteen years old version of me had every reason to think ahead for his upcoming high 
       school journey. My middle school hours flew by without notice. Months after I graduated the middle school, the first 
       day of my high school career finally came. I was born ready for these minutes and eager to face every obstacle.

As soon as my dad’s car approached my high school, I was amazed at how enormous and gorgeous it was. On a large rock nearby,
 the name of this great institution is proudly engraved- Fossil Ridge High School. During the first day, I made many friends 
 that came from all around the world. Diversity is truly one of the most critical core values of my high school. The teachers 
 are friendly, caring, enthusiastic about their lessons and students. Everything seemed to be astonishing until my first English
  period. While my fellow Vietnamese classmates and I were struggling to understand the lectures, a group of the American students 
  near us started gossipping about my friends and me being “non-native born” and how bad we were at speaking and writing English. 
  They even used some inappropriate words to despise our mother countries and mocked us as the failures of America. Of course, 
  fluently speaking a different language and becoming successful in a foreign country require many years to achieve.  
  Although we heard them clearly and disagreed with what they said, I told my friends to ignore and turn these disparagements
   into motivations to learn harder to improve our English skills. One day, we will show them that our hard work will beat their talent
    unconditionally. They didn't have any rights to judge our futures. As much as we respected them, they disrespected us. <br>
    Since that moment, I have always worked and studied tirelessly to prove that I’m here to beat any challenges. Eventually, the only student in my classes who arrived the earliest and went home the last was me.After school hours, I usually helped tutoring 
    Math for my friends to practice my math and communication skills.
     In my sophomore year, I was chosen as the social committee member of the student council and the speaker for my
      advanced writing class. Proudly, I could now speak and write in English smoothly. At the end of my junior year, I traveled
       back to Vietnam to help to distribute the food to many needy kids. Whenever I  see their smiles, all of my tiredness and 
       anxieties fade away like we share the same happiness. Every night, the kids and I sat next to each other and recalled our
        stories. After hearing the stories about their complicated lives, my eyes were wet with tears as I wished to assist them more.
         Before the departure date, I promised these kids that I will study the hardest and come back to help them get out of poverty. <br>
